## Welcome

Hello and welcome! This Reposistory is to Document my Progress as I create a java program that will project 3-D objects onto your 2-D screen.
This is to help me become more proficient with Java and as, in my opinion a cool Personal Project.

## Plan

My plan for this project is as follows:

First create a program that will be able to render a plane that is orthogonal to the x y z axis


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
